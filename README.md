# Additional Extractors

## About
This repository contains additional functionality for the [Extractor Project](https://github.com/Kisaro/extractor).
Each extractor is contained within a single _nameOfExtractor.js_ file and is either deemed experimental or not useful enough (for a bigger audience) to be packaged with the main extractor project.

## Extractors
This optional repository contains the following extractors:
- **GoogleExtractor**: Show some information about your input based on Google Knowledge Graph.
- **ThkoelnExtractor**: Currently extracts canteen menus of certain cologne universities (TH Köln: Deutz-IWZ,Gummersbach and Universität Köln: UniMensa)

## Installation
Installation of additional extractors is easy as pie!
Just make sure you have [Extractor](https://github.com/Kisaro/extractor#installation) already installed/cloned somewhere.

Next you clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kisaro/extractor-addons.git
```
And copy any extractor you like inside the ```<ExtractorMainFolder>/js/``` directory.
Extractor will pick them up automatically on start!
